The derived regressors are the raw six motion parameters (6), their derivatives (6), the parameters and their derivatives time-shifted one TR forward (12), and the parameters and their derivatives time-shifted one TR backward (12). The correlations are performed on a series of 1000 permutations, in which 90 percent of the volumes are selected from both the component time series and the motion parameters. The correlation is performed between each permuted component time series and each permuted regressor in the motion parameter model, as well as the squared versions of both. The maximum correlation coefficient from each permutation is retained and these correlation coefficients are averaged across permutations for the final metric.",
